## Required proprietary technology

(This section is used to answer this question from the Process Document: "What proprietary technology is required to implement the areas addressed by the request, and what terms are associated with its use? Again, many answers are possible, but the specific answer will affect the Team's decision." This entire section may be omitted if no proprietary technology is associated with the use of this technology. If there is proprietary technology that is being disclosed, then be sure that the relationship between the disclosure and any licensing commitments is crystal clear.)
